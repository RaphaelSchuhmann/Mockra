# Mockra

Mockra is a **config-driven local mock API server** designed to help developers test frontend and backend applications without relying on real APIs. Define your endpoints, responses, and behaviors in YAML — spin it up, point your client, and start testing.

---

## Features

- Define endpoints entirely via YAML configuration
- Configure response bodies, headers, and status codes
- Optional latency simulation and error injection
- Scenarios for different test cases (happy path, errors, etc.)
- Useful for frontend unit tests, integration tests, or local API simulation
